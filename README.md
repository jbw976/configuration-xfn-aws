# Crossplane configuration for Composition Functions (XFN) in AWS

This Configuration ensures that relevant packages are available in the control
plane so the platform engineer can start building with composition functions
(XFN) targeting AWS.

Specifically, functions can be written with
[function-go-templating](https://github.com/upbound/function-go-templating/) and
 IAM resources in the [Upbound Official AWS
 Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws).
